# Bateau
A lopro Minivan case using coriander plates with an optional weight/foot named after the word for "boat" in a romance language? *Surely no one's done that before...*


## Features
- Low-pro design
- Optional weight/foot to give it a typing angle of ~4.5Â°
- Compatible with Minivan PCBs using coriander plates
- Cutouts for P3D feet
- Modeled for 3D printing and using self-tapping screws
- Open source permissive license ([CERN-OHL-P](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home))

## Want one?

All relevant STL and STEP files for production can be found above
 
**Additional parts needed:**
- Minivan PCB of your choice and a coriander plate
- 4 M2x~5mm screws
- 4 P3D feet
- Optional weight/foot
  - Requires 3 M2x6mm screws

If 3D printing, I recommend self-tapping screws. Here's some suggestions from McMaster-Carr
- M2x5mm Screws for the plate: [here](https://www.mcmaster.com/96817A207/)
- M2x6mm Screws for the Weight: [here](https://www.mcmaster.com/95893A165/)
- Depending on your print, generic machine screws may work just fine.

## Plates
Low-pro cases like this look (in my opinion) best with single-layout plates. There are files for thicc single-layout minisub split plates in the [Plates](https://github.com/Chronomap/Bateau/tree/main/Plates) folder. I welcome any additional single-layout plate files anyone finds/designs!

## QA Notes
- Design has only been tested as a resin print from JLC
- Take care with flexible plates, there isn't a ton of room under the PCB
- The case's bottom is roughly 3mm thick

TL;DR: Files are provided as is and I accept no liability if they aren't good

## Etc.
Use what's in this repository as you see fit, within reason. 

If you build one, shoot me some pics! I'm best contacted on Discord @Chronomap
