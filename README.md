# Bateau
A lopro Minivan case using coriander plates with an optional weight/foot named after the word for "boat" in a romance language? *Surely no one's done that before...*

## Features
- Low-pro design
- Optional weight/foot to give it a typing angle of ~4.5Â°
- Compatible with Minivan PCBs using coriander plates
- Cutouts for P3D feet
- Modeled for 3D printing and using self-tapping screws
- Open source permissive license ([CERN-OHL-P](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home))

## Want one?

All relevant STL and STEP files for production can be found above
 
**Additional parts needed:**
- Minivan PCB of your choice and a coriander plate
- 4 M2x~5mm screws
- 4 P3D feet
- Optional weight/foot
  - Requires 3 M2x6mm screws

If 3D printing, I recommend self-tapping screws. Here's some suggestions from McMaster-Carr
- M2x5mm Screws for the plate: [here](https://www.mcmaster.com/96817A207/)
- M2x8mm Screws for the Weight: [here](https://www.mcmaster.com/95893A165/)



## QA Notes
- Design is currently untested
- The case's bottom is roughly 3mm thick

TL;DR: Files are provided as is and I accept no liability if they aren't good
